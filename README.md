# MongoDB Wire Protocol for asyncio

This is a small [MongoDB Wire Protocol](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/mongodb-wire-protocol)
client implementation for Python [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).

Note: This is not an ORM, and not an easy-to-use DB client. This is a low-level protocol implementation, which can serve
as a base for more advanced and easy-to-use clients.
